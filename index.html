                    <p>For 8 years, I worked professionally as a civil engineer. After analyzing global environments and trends, as well as considering my personal interests, I made the decision to redirect my career path towards software development.</p>

                <div class="div-text-container">
                    <p>For approximately a year and a half, I dedicated a significant portion of my free time to studying and learning about topics related to frontend, backend, databases, data science, and artificial intelligence.</p>

                    <p>At this point in my journey, having explored the different branches I mentioned earlier, I can confidently say that I possess solid knowledge as a front-end developer, and I believe it's a great way to enter the technology industry. Once I strengthen my skills as a front-end developer, my next goal will be to enhance my abilities in data science, aiming to take on roles like business intelligence or data scientist in the future.</p>

                    <p>I consider myself a dynamic and proactive individual with a strong sense of responsibility. I have a keen interest in continuous learning, excellent communication skills, adaptability to diverse environments, and a good rapport with others.</p>
                        
                    <p>If my profile piques your interest, you can find a link to my portfolio in the contact information section. The portfolio contains additional information, projects, and exercises related to various technology fields, which will give you an idea of what you can expect from me.</p>
